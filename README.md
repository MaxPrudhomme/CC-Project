# CC-Project
Cloud Computing Project for Fall Semester 2024


# SUBJECT - Audio to MIDI Web-APP
This project was built using Svelte and Azure.
It relies on Azure Blob storage for file storage, Azure WebApp for the deployment, and Azure Functions for the processing.
The conversion algorithm is [Basic Pitch by Spotify](https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch).

***This Project is no longer active. The functions will be shutoff shortly and the webapp will keep working until the end of 2024, before being moved on to archives on my [website](https://www.maxprudhomme.coms).***
